# Alpha Text Sanitizer 🛡️✍️

![Alpha Text Sanitizer Banner](assets/banner.png)

**Alpha Text Sanitizer** is a smart text-processing utility designed to sanitize restricted or sensitive words that are commonly flagged by freelance platforms such as **Fiverr** and **Upwork**.

It helps freelancers communicate clearly by transforming restricted keywords into safe, human-readable alternatives (for example, `payment` → `pa-y-ment`), reducing the risk of automated moderation detection.

---

## 🚀 Why Alpha Text Sanitizer?

Freelance marketplaces use automated systems to detect restricted words related to payments, contact sharing, or policy violations. This tool helps you:

* Avoid unnecessary chat warnings or restrictions
* Communicate important information safely
* Maintain platform compliance while staying readable
* Save time by sanitizing text automatically

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔤 Converts restricted words into safe formats
* ⚙️ Fully customizable word mappings
* ⚡ Fast and lightweight text processing
* 🔌 Easy to integrate into apps, scripts, or chat workflows
* 🧠 Human-readable output (no confusing symbols)

**Input:**

```
Please complete the payment today.
```

**Output:**

```
Please complete the pa-y-ment today.
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

Alpha Text Sanitizer scans your input text and replaces predefined restricted words using safe character separation or transformation rules.

Example transformation:

| Original Word | Sanitized Output |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| payment       | pa-y-ment        |
| whatsapp      | what-s-app       |
| email         | e-ma-il          |

> You can fully control how words are sanitized by editing the mapping configuration.

## 📦 Usage

### Basic Usage

```pseudo
inputText = "Please send the payment via WhatsApp"
outputText = sanitize(inputText)

print(outputText)
```

**Output:**

```
Please send the pa-y-ment via what-s-app
```

---

## ⚙️ Customization

You can define your own restricted words and replacement patterns:

```json
{
  "payment": "pa-y-ment",
  "whatsapp": "what-s-app",
  "email": "e-ma-il"
}
```

This makes Alpha Text Sanitizer flexible for different platforms and use cases.
